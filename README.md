# Space Weather Monitoring System (Backend)

A Spring Boot–based backend application designed to simulate a **Space Weather Monitoring System**.  
The project focuses on collecting, storing, and analyzing space weather parameters such as solar wind speed, radiation levels, geomagnetic activity (Kp Index), and CME probability.

This application is built as a **backend-only system**, following clean architecture and industry practices.  
It is intended to be extended later with authentication, authorization, and a web/UI layer.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Space weather events such as **solar flares**, **coronal mass ejections (CMEs)**, and **geomagnetic storms** can affect satellites, communication systems, navigation, and power grids.

This project simulates how a backend system:
- Receives space weather data
- Stores it in a relational database
- Evaluates alert levels based on scientific thresholds
- Exposes REST APIs for consumption by future web or mobile applications

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- RESTful APIs using Spring Boot
- Domain-based data modeling
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Automatic table creation using Hibernate
- Alert-level evaluation logic
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Easily extensible for Spring Security and frontend integration

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Web (REST APIs)**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Hibernate**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Maven**
- **Postman** (for API testing)
